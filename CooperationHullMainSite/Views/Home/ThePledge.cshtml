            <p>
                People’s Assemblies are a simple tool that will change everything.
                Public meetings, happening everywhere, replacing party politics with people power.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Hull People’s Assembly will be the first of its kind in the UK.
                And we need your help to pull it off.
            </p>
            <p>
                We’ll only launch when we have 2,000 signatures from local people.
                Pledge your support to the Hull People’s Assembly by signing here, now.
